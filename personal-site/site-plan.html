      <h3>Meals & Meal Prep</h3>
      <p>
        The questions that my site’s visitors will be expecting my site to answer for them are.
        What meals and foods should I be eating to fuel my growth in the gym?
        What food is high in protein and calories that I enjoy in a meal?
        What are budget-friendly foods that meet my requirements?
        How can I prepare some of these meals on a time crunch and without advanced cooking skills.
      </p>  
      <p>
        Once visitors come to my site they will want to:
        Browse and filter meals that meet their calorie requirements.
        Find simple and easy to follow recipes.
        Save meals or recipes so that they can come back to find them later.
        Create a grocery list for the meals they saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        My site would need to provide at least these pieces of information for every recipe:
        Recipe Name & Description
        Calories and Macronutrient Breakdown.
        Instructions on How to Prepare the Meal.
        Preparation & Cooking Time Estimate.
        Cost Estimate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will the site include meal prep options? Since meal prepping is an excellent way to stay on track with nutrition, the site will highlight easy to cook meals that can be stored and eaten throughout the week. Each recipe will include storage and reheating instructions to help users keep their meals fresh and convenient. Additionally, there will be make-ahead meal ideas to save time, as well as portable meal options for those who need quick nutrition for work, school, or travel. These meal prep-friendly recipes will help users stay consistent with their eating habits, even on a busy schedule.
      </p>  
      <p>
        Ideally, the site will allow users to filter meals based on key factors such as protein content, calorie range, meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, shakes), budget level, and cooking difficulty. This will help users quickly find meals that fit their specific goals and preferences, rather than having to scroll through an overwhelming number of options.
      </p>  
      <p>
        Will the site include meal plans? In addition to individual recipes, the site may offer sample meal plans for different calorie goals. Examples include a 2,500-calorie muscle-building plan, a 3,000-calorie meal plan, a budget-friendly bulking meal plan, and a vegetarian high-protein meal plan. Structured meal plans remove the stress of figuring out what to eat every day and give beginners a clear, practical roadmap for their nutrition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will the site include shakes and smoothies? Yes because high-calorie shakes and smoothies are one of the easiest ways for beginners to increase their calorie and protein intake without feeling overly full. The site will include a variety of protein-packed smoothies, high-calorie shakes, and meal replacement shakes that use simple, affordable ingredients. Since some beginners struggle to eat enough solid food, these liquid options will provide an easy and convenient way to meet their daily calorie and protein goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will there be a section on common diet mistakes to avoid? Yes, beginners often make mistakes when trying to gain muscle, such as eating too little protein, not tracking calories properly, relying on junk food for bulking, or skipping meals. The site will include a section on common diet mistakes and how to fix them, ensuring users don’t waste time making preventable errors. Instead of struggling with guesswork and trial and error, they’ll have clear guidance on how to eat effectively for muscle growth.

      <h3>Our Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The people that will come to visit my site will most likely be beginners in the gym looking to put on muscle. Most of them will be struggling with finding meals that fit their needs. They have difficulty finding meals that balance cost, protein content, calories, and taste. The website is supposed to serve as a one-stop website for people finding meals that fit their needs, removing the guesswork and frustration of finding all the meals elsewhere. There are plenty of general cooking recipe websites, but none are as in-depth and as specialized towards bodybuilders struggling to put on weight, and the recipes will be specifically designed for beginners to make it easy for them to build muscle.
