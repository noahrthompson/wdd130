        Ingredients
        1 cup oats (such as quick oats)
        2 cups whole milk (or soy milk, low-fat milk, etc)
        1 diced peach (or apple, mangoes, berries, etc)
        1 tbsp honey
        1 scoop protein powder (e.g. whey isolate)*
        A pinch of salt
        1 tsp cinnamon
        ¼ tsp vanilla
        </p>
        <p class="instructions">
            To make high-protein oatmeal, start by combining the oats, milk, and a pinch of salt in a pot over medium heat. Stir occasionally and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Once it begins to thicken, add in the diced peach and continue cooking for another 3–5 minutes, or until the fruit softens and the oatmeal reaches your desired consistency. Remove the pot from heat and stir in the honey, cinnamon, vanilla, and protein powder until everything is well incorporated. Transfer to a bowl and enjoy warm. You can top it with additional fruit or a sprinkle of nuts for added texture and nutrients.
