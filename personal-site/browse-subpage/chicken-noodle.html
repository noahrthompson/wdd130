    <h1 class="meal-subpage-title">Chicken Noodle Casserole</h1>
    <p class="meal-text">
        2 cups chopped celery stalks

½ cup chopped onion

2 tsp canola oil

2 lb skinned chicken legs or thighs 

½ tsp black pepper

1 tsp dried crushed thyme

¾ tsp salt

6 cups water

1 slice bread

10 oz extra-large egg noodles

1 carton (8 oz) light sour cream

2 tbsp flour

½ tsp garlic powder

nonstick cooking spray

2 tbsp snipped fresh parsley

Preheat your oven to 375°F. Meanwhile, sauté the celery and onion in oil in a skillet until they’re softened. Add the chicken with thyme, pepper, and salt in a separate pot, simmering gradually in water until it’s fully cooked. 

Remove the chicken and cook the noodles in its broth until they’re tender. Mix the sour cream, flour, and garlic powder into a creamy sauce in the same skillet as the celery and onion, then combine the noodles, sauce, and shredded chicken. 

Remove from heat and top with bread crumbs, then bake the casserole for 30 minutes in the oven at 425°F for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven when it’s finished and add a sprinkle of parsley on top.
