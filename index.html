            <p>Hi I'm, Noah! I am majoring in cybersecurity at BYU Idaho and I would like to become a cybersecurity specialist or software developer.
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy working out, playing games on my Nintendo Switch, playing chess, and playing basketball.</p>
            <p>I think learning about careers in web design is important because websites are important for businesses and also just an important part of using computers. I hope to learn how to build a good looking website for either personal use or businesses using CSS and HTML. I will use this in my professional life by being able to build a website for any company I am working for or being able to troubleshoot problems on one.</p>
